SOUND THE ALARM
SHATTER ME LIKE GLASS
COVERED IN SCARS
BUT ROSES ARE COMING THROUGH THE CRACKS
TIME THAT YOU KILLED
YOU PROMISED TO
HELP ME REBUILD
YOU CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD
SOUND THE ALARM
SAID YOU'D KEEP ME SAFE
NOW YOU'RE TEARING ME DOWN
AM I LAID TO WASTE
NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT AROUND
COME AND LEAVE YOUR MARK
VANDALIZE MY HEART
FUCK THE PAIN AWAY
MY BED IS IN RUINS
NFED YOU IN MY VEINS
DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT
COME AND LEAVE YOUR MARK
VANDALIZE HY HEART
描かれていたモナリザは君のようさ
冷たくて後をひく微笑みがさ
カラクリじかけの魔法で
壊されて狂うように
何回もTRIP
そして君にADDしたいのに
掴みようのない
そうシルクのように
SAID YOU'D KEEP ME SAFE
NOW YOU'RE TEARING ME DOWN
AM I LAID TO WASTE
NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT AROUND
COME AND LEAVE YOUR MARK
VANDALIZE MY HEART
FUCK THE PAIN AWAY
MY BED IS IN RUINS
NEED YOU IN MY VEINS
DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT
COME AND LEAVE YOUR MARK
VANDALIZE MY HEART
OH YOU'RE FUCKING CRAZY
HATE ME LOVE YOU
BREAKING BOTTLES ON THE PAVEMENT
JUST TO WATCH THEM CRASH
全て失っても 君はまだ
そこにいると信じたかった
COME AND LEAVE YOUR MARK
VANDALIZE MY HEART
虚しくても終わらせれない
諦めるほど強くはない
COME AND LEAVE YOUR MARK
VANDALIZE MY HEART
何も無くなってから気付いた
はじめから君はいなかった
COME AND LEAVE YOUR MARK
VANDALIZE MY HEART
