Sound the alarm
Shatter me like glass
Covered in scars
But roses are coming through the cracks

Time that you've killed
You promised to help me rebuild
You caught me off guard
Sound the alarm

Said you'd keep me safe
Now you're tearin' me down
Am I laid to waste now that you're not around?
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart
Fuck the pain away
My bed is in ruins
Need you in my veins
Don't know how you do it
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart

Then we make a work of art just so you can deface it
Did you let it fall apart just so you can replace it?
Tag your name on the side of a burning bridge
Watch it fade when the smoke rolls in

Time that you've killed
You promised to help me rebuild
Feels like you planned it
Took us for granted, oh

Said you'd keep me safe
Now you're tearin' me down
Am I laid to waste now that you're not around?
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart
Fuck the pain away
My bed is in ruins
Need you in my veins, don't know how you do it
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart

Oh, you're fucking crazy
You hate me
Love you breakin' bottles on the pavement
Just to watch them crash

Said you'd keep me safe
Now you're tearin' me down
Am I laid to waste now that you're not around?
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart
Fuck the pain away
My bed is in ruins
Need you in my veins
Don't know how you do it
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart

Said you'd keep me safe
Now you're tearin' me down
Am I laid to waste now that you're not around?
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart
